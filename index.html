<p>You will use <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheetplan">Markdown</a> and <a href="https://plantuml.com/">PlantUML</a> to describe a software architecture model about your own project.</p>
<p>This document will grow during the semester as you sketch and refine your software architecture model.</p>
<p>When you are done with each task, please push so we can give you feedback about your work.</p>
<p>We begin by selecting a suitable project domain.</p>
<h1 id="ex---domain-selection"><span class='task'>1.</span>  Domain Selection</h1>
<section class="instructions"><p>Submit the name and brief description (about 100 words) of your domain using the following vision statement template:</p>
<pre><code>For [target customers]
Who [need/opportunity/problem]
The [name your project]
Is  [type of project]
That [major features, core benefits, compelling reason to buy]
Unlike [current reality or competitors]

</code></pre>
<p>Please indicate if your choice is:</p>
<ul>
<li>a project you have worked on in the past (by yourself or with a team)</li>
<li>a project you are going to work on this semester in another lecture (which one?)</li>
<li>a new project you plan to build in the future</li>
<li>some existing open source project you are interested to contribute to</li>
</ul>
<p>The chosen domain should be unique for each student.</p>
<p>Please be ready to give a 2 minute presentation about it (you can use a slide but it&#39;s not necessary)</p>
<section class="hint"><span>Hint: </span>to choose a meaningful project look at the rest of the modeling tasks which you are going to perform in the context of your domain.</section></section><p>Project Name: <em>Food Truck Tracker</em></p>
<p>Project Type: Mobile application</p>
<p>Vision Statement: </p>
<p>For students and employees who need to have a quick lunch during their midday break.</p>
<p>The Food Truck Tracker app is a mobile application (Android) that helps to keep track of food trucks that are closest to your location. The main purpose is to have a list of fast food outlets that are around to save time during lunch.</p>
<p>The application was developed in Java and was communicating with a MySQL database through a RESTful interface coded in PHP.</p>
<p>Unlike Food-Truck-Finder (iOS application) found on the AppStore, our Project works in Switzerland and was partner with some restaurants having trucks.</p>

<p>The application will be a cross-platform app</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What was the context for your decision?</li>

<p>What is the goal you are trying to achieve?</p>
<p>The goal is to find the more suitable technology that helps to reach a maximum of people. As we know the smartphones around the globe are not running on the same operating system. The scope of my decision is to select the of users that will use my application.</p>
<ol start="3">

<p>How many people we want to reach with the food truck application ?</p>

</ol>
<ul>
<li>Cross platform application</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>As the concept of this application is based on locating places around the user there is not a specific requirement in terms of hardware that can block the development of the application on both platforms (iOS &amp; Android). Even if the Android operating system has a big part of the market, you always have to select a specific minimum version of Android to develop on it. This will result in a loss of parts of market. iOS instead is the smallest part of the market but it represent still more thant 20% of it so it would be a waste to lose those users.</p>
<p>On top of that it cost more to develop a native solution on both operating systems so an hybrid cross-platform solution will be the best option.</p>
<p>List the positive consequences (pros)</p>
<ul>
<li>One code, two operating systems</li>
<li>Reaches almost the whole market</li>
<li>Requires less time than implementing two solutions</li>
<li>Easier to maintain</li>
</ul>
<p>If any, list the negative consequences (cons)</p>
<ul>
<li>Less flexibility on functionalities</li>
<li>May not be optimized in terms of performances</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="adr-2">ADR #2</h2>
<ol>
<li>What did you decide?</li>
</ol>
<p>The more suitable cross-platform technology will be React Native</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What was the context for your decision?</li>
</ol>
<p>What is the goal you are trying to achieve?</p>
<p>The goal is to find the best technology to build the mobile cross-platform application. There are different frameworks that offer the possibility to develop applications cross-platform, however they have not all the same performances or the same programming language.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
</ol>
<p>What will be the best technology as developer to implement the application ?</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which alternative options did you consider?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Kotlin</li>
<li>React Native</li>
<li>Flutter</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Which one did you choose?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>React Native</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>The main reason that I chose React Native is that I know it quite well because I developed quite a lot of apps with it, so my choice was almost straight forward. However I considered also other possibilities such as Kotlin for example but it is a very new framework and it is not a stable version so find documentation on bugs and other issues could be difficult. Flutter was also interesting but I don&#39;t have knowledge of Dart programming language so I will lose quite some time learning how everything works.</p>
<p>List the positive consequences (pros) of your decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development speed and cost</li>
<li>Code reuse and pre-developed component</li>
<li>Works everywhere</li>
<li>React Native mobile apps are visible in stores</li>
</ul>
<p>If any, list the negative consequences (cons)</p>
<ul>
<li>Updating issues when update React Native version</li>
<li>Custom modules forced to build myself</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="adr-3">ADR #3</h2>
<ol>
<li>What did you decide?</li>
</ol>
<p>The best technology for the back-end of the application would be NodeJS</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What was the context for your decision?</li>
</ol>
<p>The goal is to find the technology that can handle a significant number of connection simultaneously without blocking the server. Easy to write as a developer and quite fast.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
</ol>
<p>You may want to articulate the problem in form of a question.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which alternative options did you consider?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Java with Spring framework</li>
<li>NodeJS (Javascript) with ExpressJS</li>
<li>PHP</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Which one did you choose?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>NodeJS</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the strongest reason to select node as back-end server. Node is completely event driven and majority of the code runs basing on callbacks. This approach helps the application not to pause or sleep, but to become available for other requests.
Node can handle thousands of concurrent connections with a very minimal overhead on a single process.</p>
<p>List the positive consequences (pros) of your decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uses JavaScript, which is easy to learn</li>
<li>Active community</li>
</ul>
<p>If any, list the negative consequences (cons)</p>
<ul>
<li>NodeJS is not suited for CPU-intensive tasks</li>
<li>NodeJS is not easily scalable</li>

<p>The customization of the user interface of an application can be useful to match the taste of each user and will increment the user experience. However, the design follows some specific guidelines and you need to be aware of them before making your design incosistent.</p>
<h2 id="feasibility-vs-complexity">Feasibility vs. Complexity</h2>
<p>The feasability of a software is about the economic part and the time to market. More the software is complex the more will cost to produce so the affordability of the software decrease. Also, if a software is more complex to build it will take more time to develop and extend the time to market.</p>
<h2 id="complexity-vs-deployability">Complexity vs. Deployability</h2>
<p>A more complex software is composed by a big number of components and connections between them. To deploy all the different parts it can require some time and a lot of effort. A less complex software in terms of components will be easier to deploy in production.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(1) Should we find cases where two components cannot communicate (and are doing it wrongly) and highlight they would need an adapter?, or cases where we have already a &quot;component playing the role of adapter in the view&quot; and highlight only the adapter?</p>
<p><em>Both are fine. We assumed that if you draw a dependency (or a connector) the interfaces match, but if you detect that the components that should communicate cannot communicate then of course introduce an adapter to solve the mismatch</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>(2) Please show the details about the two interfaces which do not match (e.g., names of parameters, object structures) so that it becomes clear why an adapter is needed and what the adapter should do to bridge the mismatch</p>
</li>
<li><p>(5-6) These questions are about the implications on coupling based on the decisions you documented in the connector view.
Whenever you have a connector you couple together the components and different connectors will have different forms of coupling</p>
<p>For example, if you use calls everywhere, do you really need them everywhere? is there some pair of components where you could use a message queue instead?</p>
<p>Regarding the coupling facets mentioned in question 5. You do not have to answer all questions related to &quot;discovery&quot;, &quot;session&quot;, &quot;binding&quot;, &quot;interaction&quot;, &quot;timing&quot;, &quot;interface&quot; and &quot;platform&quot; (p.441, Coupling Facets).

<p>For the SVG Marker adapter, there is a mismatch on format of images. The Google Maps API require an SVG image, but the mobile application provides only PNG or JPEG images. An adapter is needed to bridge the mismatch and convert the images to the SVG format such as they can be used by the Google Maps API to draw the markers of the food trucks.</p>
<p>(Invented Adapter) For the JSON to Object adapter, there is a mismatch between the JSON provided by the REST API and the object structure of the mobile application. The adapter should convert the JSON to the object structure of the mobile application that could be used by the mobile application to display the information of the food trucks. This could be seen as a bridge between the REST API and the mobile application.</p>

<p>One of the motivation that could be the reason for introducing an adapter is to change the API or the framework providing the map service. Google Maps is not the only map service, but it is the most popular one. However it needs a payment subscription that could be expensive if there are a lot of requests on the application. A better solution could be to use a free map service like OpenStreetMap or HereMaps so an adapter to switch easily between them is needed.</p>
<h3 id="5">5.</h3>
<p>There is a coupling between Google Maps API and the Mobile Application components, because the Mobile application depends on the Maps API to retrieve the location of the user (geocode position). The computation of the geocode position is done by the Google Maps API has to be fast and reliable to get all the trucks around the user.</p>

<p>   When the REST API is not available provide a rapid solution to reduce the impact of the application.</p>

<li>Which alternative options did you consider?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Watchdog</li>
<li>Heartbeat</li>

<li>Which one did you choose?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Watchdog</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>   The implementation of a watchdog is a good choice because it is very simple and easy. It is also very reliable and can permit to perform actions on the hosting server such as restarting the platform if needed. The downtime will be therefore very short.</p>

<li>What did you decide?</li>
</ol>
<p>   Asynchronous replication.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What was the context for your decision?</li>
</ol>
<p>   What is the goal you are trying to achieve?</p>
<p>   The goal is to recover the application as soon as possible.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
</ol>
<p>   Maximize availability and keep the consistency of the application.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which alternative options did you consider?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Synchronous replication</li>
<li>Asynchronous replication</li>
<li>No replication</li>

<ul>
<li>Asynchronous replication</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>   The asynchronous replication is a good choice because it maintains both availability and consistency in most of the cases. The synchronous replication is not necessary because I do not need to wait for the application to be fully recovered.</p>

<p>   In my case, lots of compoenents are connected togther. Therefore a cascading failure will be a big problem for my system. A circuit breaker on the api will be the best solution to not propagate the failure to the other components such as the database. The circuit breaker could relie on the watchdog to detect the failure. The system should also be ready to switch on a replica of the hosting server in case of failure.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>The two external dependency I have are the auth service and the Google Maps API. If the auth service is down, the app can not authenticate users and can not perform queries that need authentication. Other queries that will do not require authentication will remain unaffected. A possible mitigation is that we can keep authenticating users that have a valid token. If the Google Maps API is down, the app can not display the map or compute the geolocation of the user. This will have a big impact on the application. A mitigation could be to be able to switch from a Maps provider to another one rapidly.</li>

<section class="instructions "><p>Now that your architecture delivers your software as a service, let&#39;s redesign it so that it can scale!</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Pick one scalability dimension: number of clients, size of input, size of state, number of dependencies</p>
</li>
<li><p>How well does your architecture scale along the chosen dimension? Where do you expect the bottleneck to be?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Modify your architecture to remove the scalability bottleneck you have identified (show both logical, process and deployment view) - consider whether the API/interface of the bottleneck component should be improved.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Write an ADR regarding the scalability pattern you have introduced.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Write an ADR regarding the issue of component discovery, choosing one of the alternatives: dependency injection vs. directory. Can you identify an existing component playing the role of directory/dependency injection container? Could you give an example of where you would need to add such component to facilitate dynamic component discovery?</p>

<section class="instructions "><p>Only dead software stops changing. You just received a message from your customer, they have an idea. Is your architecture ready for it?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Pick a new use case scenario. Precisely, what exactly do you need to change of your existing architecture so that it can be supported? Model the updated logical/process/deployment views.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pick another use case scenario so that it can be supported without any major architectural change (i.e., while you cannot add new components, it is possible to extend the interface of existing ones or introduce new dependencies). Illustrate with a process view, how your previous design can satisfy the new requirement.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change impact. One of your externally sourced component/Web service API has announced it will introduce a breaking change. What is the impact of such change? How can you control and limit the impact of such change? Update your logical view</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open up your architecture so that it can be extended with plugins by its end-users. Where would be a good extension point? Update your logical view and give at least one example of what a plugin would actually do.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Assuming you have a centralized deployment with all stateful components storing their state in the same database, propose a strategy to split the monolith into at least two different microservices. Model the new logical/deployment view as well as the interfaces of each microservice you introduce.</p>
