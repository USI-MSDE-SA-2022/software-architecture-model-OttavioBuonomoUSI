<p>You will use <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheetplan">Markdown</a> and <a href="https://plantuml.com/">PlantUML</a> to describe a software architecture model about your own project.</p>
<p>This document will grow during the semester as you sketch and refine your software architecture model.</p>
<p>When you are done with each task, please push so we can give you feedback about your work.</p>
<p>We begin by selecting a suitable project domain.</p>
<h1 id="ex---domain-selection"><span class='task'>1.</span>  Domain Selection</h1>
<section class="instructions"><p>Submit the name and brief description (about 100 words) of your domain using the following vision statement template:</p>
<pre><code>For [target customers]
Who [need/opportunity/problem]
The [name your project]
Is  [type of project]
That [major features, core benefits, compelling reason to buy]
Unlike [current reality or competitors]
Our Project [summarize main advantages over status quo, unique selling point]
</code></pre>
<p>Please indicate if your choice is:</p>
<ul>
<li>a project you have worked on in the past (by yourself or with a team)</li>
<li>a project you are going to work on this semester in another lecture (which one?)</li>
<li>a new project you plan to build in the future</li>
<li>some existing open source project you are interested to contribute to</li>
</ul>
<p>The chosen domain should be unique for each student.</p>
<p>Please be ready to give a 2 minute presentation about it (you can use a slide but it&#39;s not necessary)</p>
<section class="hint"><span>Hint: </span>to choose a meaningful project look at the rest of the modeling tasks which you are going to perform in the context of your domain.</section></section><p>Project Name: <em>Food Truck Tracker</em></p>
<p>Project Type: Mobile application</p>
<p>Vision Statement: </p>
<p>For students and employees who need to have a quick lunch during their midday break.</p>
<p>The Food Truck Tracker app is a mobile application (Android) that helps to keep track of food trucks that are closest to your location. The main purpose is to have a list of fast food outlets that are around to save time during lunch.</p>
<p>The application was developed in Java and was communicating with a MySQL database through a RESTful interface coded in PHP.</p>
<p>Unlike Food-Truck-Finder (iOS application) found on the AppStore, our Project works in Switzerland and was partner with some restaurants having trucks.</p>

<p>The application will be a cross-platform app</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What was the context for your decision?</li>
</ol>
<p>What is the goal you are trying to achieve?</p>
<p>The goal is to find the more suitable technology that helps to reach a maximum of people. As we know the smartphones around the globe are not running on the same operating system. The scope of my decision is to select the of users that will use my application.</p>
<ol start="3">

<p>How many people we want to reach with the food truck application ?</p>

</ol>
<ul>
<li>Cross platform application</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>As the concept of this application is based on locating places around the user there is not a specific requirement in terms of hardware that can block the development of the application on both platforms (iOS &amp; Android). Even if the Android operating system has a big part of the market, you always have to select a specific minimum version of Android to develop on it. This will result in a loss of parts of market. iOS instead is the smallest part of the market but it represent still more thant 20% of it so it would be a waste to lose those users.</p>
<p>On top of that it cost more to develop a native solution on both operating systems so an hybrid cross-platform solution will be the best option.</p>
<p>List the positive consequences (pros)</p>
<ul>
<li>One code, two operating systems</li>
<li>Reaches almost the whole market</li>
<li>Requires less time than implementing two solutions</li>
<li>Easier to maintain</li>
</ul>
<p>If any, list the negative consequences (cons)</p>
<ul>
<li>Less flexibility on functionalities</li>
<li>May not be optimized in terms of performances</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="adr-2">ADR #2</h2>
<ol>
<li>What did you decide?</li>
</ol>
<p>The more suitable cross-platform technology will be React Native</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What was the context for your decision?</li>
</ol>
<p>What is the goal you are trying to achieve?</p>
<p>The goal is to find the best technology to build the mobile cross-platform application. There are different frameworks that offer the possibility to develop applications cross-platform, however they have not all the same performances or the same programming language.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
</ol>
<p>What will be the best technology as developer to implement the application ?</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which alternative options did you consider?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Kotlin</li>
<li>React Native</li>
<li>Flutter</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Which one did you choose?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>React Native</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>The main reason that I chose React Native is that I know it quite well because I developed quite a lot of apps with it, so my choice was almost straight forward. However I considered also other possibilities such as Kotlin for example but it is a very new framework and it is not a stable version so find documentation on bugs and other issues could be difficult. Flutter was also interesting but I don&#39;t have knowledge of Dart programming language so I will lose quite some time learning how everything works.</p>
<p>List the positive consequences (pros) of your decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development speed and cost</li>
<li>Code reuse and pre-developed component</li>
<li>Works everywhere</li>
<li>React Native mobile apps are visible in stores</li>
</ul>
<p>If any, list the negative consequences (cons)</p>
<ul>
<li>Updating issues when update React Native version</li>
<li>Custom modules forced to build myself</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="adr-3">ADR #3</h2>
<ol>
<li>What did you decide?</li>
</ol>
<p>The best technology for the back-end of the application would be NodeJS</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What was the context for your decision?</li>
</ol>
<p>The goal is to find the technology that can handle a significant number of connection simultaneously without blocking the server. Easy to write as a developer and quite fast.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
</ol>
<p>You may want to articulate the problem in form of a question.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which alternative options did you consider?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Java with Spring framework</li>
<li>NodeJS (Javascript) with ExpressJS</li>
<li>PHP</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Which one did you choose?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>NodeJS</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the strongest reason to select node as back-end server. Node is completely event driven and majority of the code runs basing on callbacks. This approach helps the application not to pause or sleep, but to become available for other requests.
Node can handle thousands of concurrent connections with a very minimal overhead on a single process.</p>
<p>List the positive consequences (pros) of your decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uses JavaScript, which is easy to learn</li>
<li>Active community</li>
</ul>
<p>If any, list the negative consequences (cons)</p>
<ul>
<li>NodeJS is not suited for CPU-intensive tasks</li>
<li>NodeJS is not easily scalable</li>

<p>The customization of the user interface of an application can be useful to match the taste of each user and will increment the user experience. However, the design follows some specific guidelines and you need to be aware of them before making your design incosistent.</p>
<h2 id="feasibility-vs-complexity">Feasibility vs. Complexity</h2>
<p>The feasibility of a software is about the economic part and the time to market. More the software is complex the more will cost to produce so the affordability of the software decrease. Also, if a software is more complex to build it will take more time to develop and extend the time to market.</p>
<h2 id="complexity-vs-deployability">Complexity vs. Deployability</h2>
<p>A more complex software is composed by a big number of components and connections between them. To deploy all the different parts it can require some time and a lot of effort. A less complex software in terms of components will be easier to deploy in production.</p>
<h1 id="ex---feature-modeling"><span class='task'>5.</span>  Feature Modeling</h1>
<section class="instructions"><p>In the context of your chosen project domain, describe your domain using a feature model.</p>
<p>The feature model should be correctly visualized using the following template:</p>

<section class="instructions"><p>Within the context of your project domain, represent a model of your modular software architecture decomposed into components.</p>
<p>The number of components in your logical view should be between 6 and 9:</p>
<ul>
<li>At least one component should be further decomposed into sub components</li>
<li>At least one component should already exist. You should plan how to reuse it, by locating it in some software repository and including in your model the exact link to its specification and its price.</li>
<li>At least one component should be stateful.</li>
</ul>
<p>The logical view should represent provide/require dependencies that are consistent with the interactions represented in the process view.</p>
<p>The process view should illustrate how the proposed decomposition is used to satisfy the main use case given by your domain model.</p>
<p>You can add additional process views showing how other use cases can be satisfied by the same set of components.</p>
<p>This assignment will focus on modularity-related decisions, we will worry about deployment and the container view later.</p>

<p>Get started with one of these PlantUML templates, or you can come up with your own notation to describe the interfaces, as long as it includes all the necessary details.</p>

<li>Introduce a wrapper in your architecture to hide one of the previously highlighted adapters</li>
<li>Where would standard interfaces play a role in your architecture? Which standards could be relevant in your domain?</li>

<h2 id="hints">Hints</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>(1) Should we find cases where two components cannot communicate (and are doing it wrongly) and highlight they would need an adapter?, or cases where we have already a &quot;component playing the role of adapter in the view&quot; and highlight only the adapter?</p>
<p><em>Both are fine. We assumed that if you draw a dependency (or a connector) the interfaces match, but if you detect that the components that should communicate cannot communicate then of course introduce an adapter to solve the mismatch</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>(2) Please show the details about the two interfaces which do not match (e.g., names of parameters, object structures) so that it becomes clear why an adapter is needed and what the adapter should do to bridge the mismatch</p>
</li>
<li><p>(5-6) These questions are about the implications on coupling based on the decisions you documented in the connector view.
Whenever you have a connector you couple together the components and different connectors will have different forms of coupling</p>
<p>For example, if you use calls everywhere, do you really need them everywhere? is there some pair of components where you could use a message queue instead?</p>
<p>Regarding the coupling facets mentioned in question 5. You do not have to answer all questions related to &quot;discovery&quot;, &quot;session&quot;, &quot;binding&quot;, &quot;interaction&quot;, &quot;timing&quot;, &quot;interface&quot; and &quot;platform&quot; (p.441, Coupling Facets). Just the ones that you think are relevant for your design and by answering them you can get ideas on how to do question 6.</p>

</section><h1 id="ex---physical-and-deployment-views"><span class='task'>12.</span>  Physical and Deployment Views</h1>
<section class="instructions"><p>a. Extend your architectural model with the following viewpoints:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Physical or Container View</p>
</li>
<li><p>Deployment View</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Your model should be non-trivial: include more than one physical device/virtual container (or both). Be ready to discuss which connectors are found at the device/container boundaries.</p>
<p>b. Write an ADR about which deployment strategy you plan to adopt. The alternatives to be considered are: big bang, blue/green, shadow, pilot, gradual phase-in, canary, A/B testing.</p>
<p>c. (Optional) Prepare a demo of a basic continuous integration and delivery pipeline for your architectural documentation so that you can obtain a single, integrated PDF with all the viewpoints you have modeled so far. </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>configure a GitHub webhook to be called whenever you push changes to your documentation</li>

<section class="instructions "><p>The goal of this week is to plan how to deliver your software as a service with high availability.</p>
<ol>
<li>If necessary, change your deployment design so that your software is hosted on a server (which could be running as a Cloud VM). Your SaaS architecture should show how your SaaS can be remotely accessed from a client such as a Web browser, or a mobile app</li>
<li>Sketch your software as a service pricing model (optional)</li>
<li>How would you define the availability requirements in your project domain? For example, what would be your expectation for the duration of planned/unplanned downtimes or the longest response time tolerated by your clients?</li>
<li>Which strategy do you adopt to monitor your service&#39;s availability? Extend your architecture with a watchdog or a heartbeat monitor and motivate your choice with an ADR.</li>
<li>What happens when a stateless component goes down? model a sequence diagram to show what needs to happen to recover one of your critical stateless components</li>
<li>How do you plan to recover stateful components? write an ADR about your choice of replication strategy and whether you prefer consistency vs. availability. Also, consider whether event sourcing would help in your context.</li>
<li>How do you plan to avoid cascading failures? Be ready to discuss how the connectors (modeled in your connector view) impact the reliability of your architecture.</li>
<li>How did you mitigate the impact of your external dependencies being not available? (if applicable)</li>
